# odin-recipes
I am creating my first website using HTML (no CSS). This is the first real project I'm undertaking in The Odin Project. I will list skills used below this intro as I come across the need to use them. - Dan

First update: I created the home page (index.html), I also created 3 subpages for each recipe. I included a link from the home page to each recipe using relative links and set them to open in a new tab. Then I included a link back to the home page on each recipe and gave them the self target.

Second update: I added a picture to each recipe page. To acomplish this I created an images folder in the root folder (sibling to index.html). Then I added a pic of each food and used the img tag (with alt and height/weight attributes) to each page.
