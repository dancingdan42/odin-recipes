# odin-recipes
I am creating my first website using HTML (no CSS). This is the first real project I'm undertaking in The Odin Project. I will list skills used below this intro as I come across the need to use them. - Dan

First update: I created the home page (index.html), I also created 3 subpages for each recipe. I included a link from the home page to each recipe using relative links and set them to open in a new tab. Then I included a link back to the home page on each recipe and gave them the self target.

Second update: I added a picture to each recipe page. To acomplish this I created an images folder in the root folder (sibling to index.html). Then I added a pic of each food and used the img tag (with alt and height/weight attributes) to each page.

Third update: I added a heading (h3) that says "Description" on each recipe page followed by a paragraph (<p></p>) describing it.

Fourth update: This was a big one. I added two lists on each recipe page. The first was an unordered list (<ul></ul>) to show ingredients. The second was an ordered list (<ol></ol>) to show steps to cook the recipe. Then I also turned the links on the home page into an unordered list as well.
